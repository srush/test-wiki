# Neural_Iterated_Learning

Pytorch implementation of the paper 'XXXXXXXXX'.

Hey:

Thanks for your interest in our work. We apologize that this is a very fundamental version of our work. But we promise to update it latter. However, due to the time constraints (the authors are fascinated by another topic related to iterated learning and do not want to spend too much time on this task :-( ), the update might come later, as we plan to combine different applications of XXXXXXXX and release a thorough code or toolkit for it.
